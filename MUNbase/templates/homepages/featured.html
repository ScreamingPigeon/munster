          <section>
            <p>By Arnav Joshi</p>
            <p>Easily among the most gruesome and neck to neck elections over the last two  decades, the Bengal elections finally began polling last week. On 27th march, 30  constituencies in Bengal went to the booth, with 191 candidates competing for these  seats. This marked the beginning of an election, which has been prefaced with  opposition being tear gassed, chief ministers getting physically attacked (allegedly  at least) the families of political workers getting attacked, the list goes on. The  discussion of this article, however, is going to be a discussion of the claims made by  the two political stalwarts battling it out, Mamata Banerjee and Amit Shah. Union  Home Minister Amit Shah claims that the BJP will win 26 out of the 30 seats in phase  one of the elections, whereas incumbent chief minister Banerjee believes that  higher voter turnout is a clear sign of a pro incumbency sentiment. Let’s look at  which of these two sides really will end up reigning supreme. Will Didi retain her  prized possession, or will the saffron engulf yet another state.</p>
            <p>First things first, yes, this is a purely two horse race. The left alliance does in fact have  some sway over the final results in seats and could be the deciding X factor, however  thinking that they can win would be wishful thinking at best and naivety at worst  from their end. The best possible outcome for the left would be for neither the BJP  nor the TMC to get an absolute majority, hence giving the left a possible bargaining  chip for the formation of a Mahagathbandhan of sorts. </p>
            <p>First off, what the BJP has going for it, is its traditional no stone left unturned  mindset. The BJPs dedication towards political advancements has always allowed  them to treat every election in a do or die manner. When the BJP sees any chance  of winning an election, the prime minister, the home minister, the president of the  BJP, and other BJP stalwarts are seen campaigning day in and day out. No prize is  too small for the BJPs work, and no government is too stable for the BJP to attempt  destabilisation. Both of these were exemplified by the parties orchestrated  breakdown of the Puducherry government. Both Amit Shah and Narendra Modi  himself have been campaigning themselves in Bengal day in and day out in the  month leading up to the elections. This is a degree of 'star power' that no other party  can achieve. The power of a Modi led campaign has been seen in 2014 and 2019 in  the general elections, 2017 in UP, and most recently, in 2020 in Bihar where  Narendra Modi was the face of the campaign while Nitish Kumar sat back. Thus, the  BJP have their ever so active attitude going for them.  </p>
            <p>The BJP has another thing going for them, their ability to construe themselves as a  pan India party. Through this, they have managed to keep on the low the "outsiders"  narrative. What the BJP have going for them is the fact that despite technically  running a campaign led by two individuals largely based in Delhi and Gujarat, they  have managed to dismiss the outsider’s narrative as rather cliche, arguing that the  Hindu nationalist party is so pervasive, that every part of the Hindustan is where they  very much belong. This, coupled with the Hindutva vote bank they have, consisting of majorly middle class and upper middle-class Hindus, leaves little for Mamata  Banerjee to harp onto. She could’ve used her Bengal Ki Beti image, but in the year  leading up to the elections the Bhartiya Janata party had made it a point to co-opt  that identity as well. Subtle references to Bengali culture such as appreciation for  Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore etc, were all it took to get the  two giants on an almost equal footing when it comes to the cultural power they  wield.  </p>
            <p>The BJP, however, have one clear area where they are lacking, which is something  Mamata Banerjee will be hoping plays a big role. The 'national security' and  'Pakistani' narrative. Taking the four major elections as an example, General  elections of 2014 and 19, Uttar Pradesh elections of 2017, and Bihar 2020, we can see  how important these narratives are. During the 2014 elections, BJP used the  argument that the congress had been soft on Pakistan and soft on terror,  something they wanted to change as laid out in their manifesto. Similarly, during  the 2017 Uttar Pradesh elections, the BJP used their Surgical strikes in Pakistan as  the narrative to support their hard stance against any threat to Indian Sovereignty.  The Balakot air strike served the same purpose during the 2019 general elections,  and in 2020 Bihar elections the BJP put forth the argument that an RJD victory  would be the equivalent of a Diwali gift which will be celebrated in Pakistan. One  can’t help but notice a trend.... This time over, however, they have failed to use one  of their biggest selling points. This could work against them.  </p>
            <p>Finally, what Banerjee will be counting the most on is the historical context and  contemporary paradigm in which this elect. The BJP usually has one or both of two  things going for themselves. Firstly, the BJP usually dominates in states that share  the Hindi heartlands philosophies and belief systems. In states where this does not  work, they hope to have an opposition that has neither an ideology more influential  than Hindutva, nor a socio-religious vote bank that the opposition can rely on. In  states where this environment doesn’t exist, BJP tends to underperform, as seen in  South India. Firstly, Bengal has its own ideals, believes and political ecosystem, one  based on Bengali heritage and pride, one completely different from that of the Hindi heartland. Secondly, Mamata Banerjee being a ten-year incumbent right-wing leader would be more likely to draw the moderate Hindu vote bank, and will be  hoping to cutting into the OBC pie as made clear by the TMC manifesto. This might  create a road block for the BJP. </p>
            <p>When it boils down to it however, this will be an extremely close election. Current  media predictions suggest that it will be a narrow BJP victory, and while that is a  safe pick, I believe the initial Left road block I mentioned might play a pivotal role. If  they manage to take away 35 odd seats, there may not end up being a party with  the majority. We might really end up having a loose Gathbandhan with the left  holding all the cards.</p>

        <section id = "SyrianCivilWar">
          <p>By Jash Bhatia</p>
          <p>A peaceful uprising against the then President of Syria in 2011 escalated into a massive civil war. 10 years on, the battle has not ceased.</p>
          <p>Under President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian citizens had been subjected to high unemployment rates, corruption, and political unrest. Finally, in 2011, the nation reached its tipping point and pro-democracy revolts began stirring up all over the country. Meanwhile, the Syrian government used deadly force to crush the rebellions as the people protested demanding the resignation of the president. The supporters of the opposition parties began taking up arms to protect themselves as the crackdown intensified.</p>
          <p>Rebel groups sprang up all around the country as violence escalated – and the foreign powers of the world came into play. Mr Assad promised this “foreign-backed terrorism” would be crushed, as the civil war became much more than a battle between Syrians for or against the President. Extremist organizations such as the IS and al-Qaeda became involved, which prompted concern among the international community.</p>
          <p>With hundreds of thousands of deaths, over 2 million civilians have sufferedinjuries and disabilities as a result of the conflict. Over 55% of Syrians have been uprooted from their homes, and even medical facilities have been attacked. UN war crimes investigators have accused all parties of perpetrating "the most heinous violations". "Syrians," their latest report says, "have suffered vast aerial bombardments of densely populated areas; they have endured chemical weapons attacks and modern day sieges in which perpetrators deliberately starved the population along medieval scripts and indefensible and shameful restrictions on humanitarian aid."</p>
          <p>More recently, the government has regained control of Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by rebels, jihadists and the Kurdish-led SDF. The last remaining opposition stronghold is in the province of Idlib and parts of northern Hama and western Aleppo provinces.</p>
          <p>The region is dominated by a jihadist alliance called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), but is also home to mainstream rebel factions. An estimated 2.7 million displaced people, including a million children, are living there, many of them in dire conditions in camps.</p>
          <p>In March 2020, Russia and Turkey brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. There has been a relative calm since then, but it could break down at any moment. In the country's north-east, Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels launched an offensive against the SDF in October 2019 to create a "safe zone" clear of Kurdish YPG militia along the Syrian side of the border, and have occupied it since.</p>
          <p>The UN Security Council has called for the implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communiqué, which implies formation of a transitional governing  body "formed on the basis of mutual consent". Nine rounds of UN-mediated peace talks - known as the Geneva II process - failed to make progress, with  President Assad apparently unwilling to negotiate with political opposition  groups that insist he must step down as part of any settlement. </p>
          <p>In 2021, the situation has far from settled down even remotely. Syria lies in  ruins, and Assad, the perpetrator of hundreds of war crimes, remains  adamant that he will not back down until his lust for power is satisfied. His  regime is using all the funding it receives not for welfare purposes, but as a  weapon for war, something that the United Nations has shamefully failed to  prevent.  </p>
          <p>The deplorable state of affairs and widespread suffering in Syria raises just  one question: has Assad won anything? The answer, it is feared, is a  resounding no. The regime has gained nothing. There are no victors in war,  only victims and perpetrators. </p>

          <p>By Ahaan Jindal</p>
          <h5 ><strong>Who’s vying for control - the major parties</strong></h5>
          <p>Pictures of Rahul Gandhi unveiling the Indian National Congress’ (INC) manifesto in Assam were made perspicuously evident on major national news channels: an indication of the Mahajoth’s - or INC coalition’s - commitment to regaining Assam, where the BJP had gained power in 2016, avenging 2011’s landslide Congress victory. The INC continues to garner traction in Assam, with a cascade of calumnious comments taking a dig at BJP’s allegedly nationalistic stance in the state coming from Rahul Gandhi: “they are attacking the culture, brotherhood and diversity in Assam.” At the same time, however, the incumbent party - the BJP’s coalition along with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) - are also wilful in their goal to keep Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in power, and regain the 126 MLA quota for the state’s 15th Legislative Assembly. Modi too took particular umbrage to the Congress’ exploits into the region, deeming the centre-left party’s policies “a display of their lack of leadership, policies and ideology.
          </p>
          <p>With polling commencing on 1st April, and fervent campaigning by three sides of the political spectrum in a post-Covid environment marred by instability - the BJP, Congress, and the United Regional Front - a “fringe” party vying to make inroads in the Northeast - the ensuing article aims to chronicle the policies and ideologies of each major front, at the eve of the Assam elections.</p>
          <h5 ><strong>What voters want</strong></h5>
          <p>A cursory glance at Assam’s economic parameters post-Covid highlights unemployment as a key issue plaguing the economy, with unemployment surging to 11.1% in April 2020. This was accompanied by a supply-chain disruption in the region, yielding a host of particularly pernicious implications for the retail and hospitality sector, as per the state’s finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sharma. Therefore, in the short-term, prospective voters would look quite favourably upon ensuring that job security is prioritized by the next cabinet, and solutions to supply and demand “shocks'' are wheedled out before vicious cycles could emerge and ravage Assam’s now-precarious economy. The tea garden workers will also prove significant to the final results, constituting a 17% majority in Assam’s population, and have actively contested lowered wages; while the Union Budget allocated a 1000 crore tranche of funds to the workers, representatives have yet complained about insufficient wages, and will seek promises of wage increases from either party. A more perennial predicament is the rampant lack of accessibility and interconnectivity in the region, which voters hope can be ring-fenced by significant infrastructure advancements. From a socio-cultural standpoint, the prevailing sentiment in the region is that the CAA needs to be repealed, made quite conspicuous by statewide December 2019 protests in the region. Assam in particular is a state wherein the implications of the CAA are the most pertinent and considerable, seeing as it was the only Indian state to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC), rendering 19 lakh inhabitants in the region “foreigners” - what was construed to be a blow for Assam’s ethnic diversity.
          </p>
          <h5 ><strong>The BJP’s bid to stay in control - their policies and ideology</strong></h5>
          <p>Firstly, the BJP’s policies in the region are mainly centred around a proliferation of infrastructure in the region, coupled with a constancy of “identity politics.” The former is evidenced by the fact that from 2016 till date, Modi has been increasing his focus on developing a slew of infrastructural establishments, ranging from longer, more interconnected roads, to schools and medical colleges, such as a 500-bed Nalbari Medical College and Hospital, for which the BJP has allocated a substantial 40 crore rupees. This largely infrastructural-focused stance stems from a severe lack of interconnectivity and what seemed like a significant topographical disadvantage for Assam in the years prior, costing the region employment opportunities as well as sociocultural integration and development. An advantage for BJP hence stems from increasing their electoral base through infrastructural consolidation - with a mammoth 37% of all highway ground built in the Seven Sisters between 2014 and 2019, as well as grandiose educational and medical edifices such as the National Law School and Lakhimpur Hospital, voters who earlier suffered from unemployment and impoverishment are gravitating towards the appeal of the BJP. The local perspectives echoed by the people of Assam largely favour this developmental phase brought to the table by the BJP; a striking example of this is shopkeeper Arun Barman’s take on why he will vote for the BJP: “There is so much work that has happened under them, especially road construction. This is something Assam needed badly. Look at our upcoming medical college, for instance, see how big and crucial it is.”  </p>
          <p>A far more ideologically-fuelled policy development in the region, however, is the public condemnation of Muslim Bangladeshis, who have seemingly “infiltrated” the region - another blatantly clear instance of the BJP’s “Hindutva” manifesto. The conservative nationalist party promises to “correct and reconcile” the currently updated Assamese NRC, and have declared that they will “exclude” all “illegal migrants” and “protect genuine Indian citizens.” This clear leaning towards the Hindutva playbook is not surprising at all, given the party’s extreme stance against Muslim All India United Democratic Front (AIUDC) leader Badruddin Ajmal, with derogatory comments such as “Ajmal...is not creating a network conducive to Assamese culture. Not as an individual, but as a group of certain people, they are our enemy,” coming from BJP Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. This apparent vendetta is clearly symbolic of BJP’s religious-secularism in the region, indicating that the BJP wishes to gain the traction of Hindu conservatives throughout the region, by appealing to the “pathos” of identity and oneness in the region. This has ostensibly propelled a significant proportion of religion-based policies: the BJP, aside from reforming the NRC, also wishes to protect Neo-Vaishnavite monasteries in the region, and solely provide land to “Indian citizens” - a bid to expand their vote banks to a vast majority of Hindus.</p>
          <p>From a social viewpoint, the BJP has, through the “ten commitment manifesto”, or “10 Sankalp for Atmanirbhar Assam”, promised to provide free education to every child, and have focused on developing schemes to reduce the material, human and geological impact of floods in the region, in light of the catastrophic 2020 Assam Floods, which claimed 149 lives and adversely impacted 30 out of 33 Assamese districts. Furthermore, the commitments also give assurance that families who fall under the “Orunodoi” scheme, which provides Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to around 17 lakh families in the state, will see a 261% increase in DBT, plus land rights, if the BJP comes into power. These social endeavours greatly mirror the ideological aim of “Atma Nirbhar”, or self-sufficiency for the region, and have played a significant role in polling numbers already, evidenced by the 42.1% BJP support in the exit polls.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the BJP has, through its infrastructural and developmental, religious, and social policies - greatly oriented to fit their nationalistic, Hindutva ideology, as well as their Atma Nirbhar campaign - aimed to expand their voter base and re-claim the treasured 126 MLA quota the largest of the “seven sisters” of the Northeast has to offer.</p>
          <h5 ><strong>Congress’ bid to regain a former 15-year stronghold: politics, ideology, and destructive slander</strong></h5>
          <p>The Congress coalition’s (Mahajoth) economic policies in the region seem to greatly appeal to two important groups of people who hold significant bearing on electoral results: the unemployed, as well as the Tea Garden workers of Assam, who hold the key to 40 seats in the region, and a substantial 5000 crores of the state income. With regard to bolstering employment in the region, the Mahajoth, under its released 5-pronged manifesto, have promised 5 lakh jobs if they are voted into power, presenting what seems to be a strong determinant in tilting the balance more towards the Centre-left party in the exit polls, by circumventing the constant near-10% unemployment in the region post-Covid. Moreover, in order to expand their electoral reach towards the tea garden workers, Congress has guaranteed a significant 120% rise in workers’ wages, to Rs. 365 per person, and have further aimed to garner their traction by echoing the issues brought forth by numerous workers’ representatives after the BJP reneged on its promise of increasing the tea workers’ wages to Rs. 367. Finally, the Congress also assured that they will provide a Rs. 2000 monthly income support to homemakers. Therefore, the Congress economic proclamation in their 5-point plan for Assam seems to appeal more to employment opportunities, and work and interaction at the grassroots level to muster traction from the tea garden workers to swing the electoral balances in their favour.
          </p>
          <p>From a religious viewpoint, the Mahajoth’s leaders have repeatedly condemned the Hindutva-leaning ideological stance of the BJP in Assam, deeming it a policy that fails to rekindle the spirit of brotherhood and diversity in the region. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the INC and its coalition parties have made their desire to repeal the CAA abundantly evident in rallies throughout February and March 2021. The ringleaders of the coalition have also, in speeches given throughout the campaigning period, dealt blows and highlighted what they see as great flaws in the BJP’s cultural nationalism - perhaps viewing it as a chance to increase their vote-banks to include proportions of the states 3.12 crore Muslim population, who seek asylum in the region, bound by the shackles of the CAA and NRC. That being said, the Mahajoth has not pinned a lot of its electoral focus on “identity politics,” instead preferring to offer the overarching aim of repealing the CAA in Assam - making clear that their agenda in the region transcends religious boundaries, and focuses more on socioeconomic amelioration.
          </p>
          <p>With regard to the social manifesto, the Congress seems to target issues on a grassroots level, and have actively campaigned in various districts, to considerably improve the lives and conditions for workers, mirroring their left-leaning ideology. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for example, visited the Sadhguru tea gardens in Assam earlier this month, and plucked tea leaves in solidarity with the disillusioned tea workers, to further reinforce the INC’s stance: “While they [BJP] have the money and the administration, we are campaigning better at the grassroots level.” With this stance firmly in mind, the Mahajoth has also actively rallied against surging fuel prices, holding statewide protests, some of which were led by MP Gaurav Gogoi, and have repeatedly alleged that the BJP has blatantly ignored the vicissitudes in fuel prices - yet another important social talking-point of the upcoming elections. In addition, the Mahajoth coalition also aims to provide free electricity upto 200 units in certain select districts in Assam, as mentioned by Rahul Gandhi in a March 2021 rally in Guwahati, in order to further their mass appeal.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, while the BJP’s main economic focus in Assam is infrastructure and increased interconnectivity, the Congress-led coalition has aimed to address the Covid-19-induced unemployment plaguing the entire state, and also various socioeconomic concerns; they also seem to not be excessively involved in “identity politics” and religious undertones, and as of now are fundamentally opposed to the CAA.
          </p>
          <h5 ><strong>Conclusion - what the polls indicate and a summary of the contesting parties</strong></h5>
          <p>The elections of Assam are one that is significant in the landscape of Indian politics, in that it will establish lasting patterns of leadership in the largest, most influential state of the Northeast: it may turn into a swing state for the May 2024 elections, or a BJP stronghold. The exit polls so far appear extremely closely contested, with a mere 2% difference between the BJP and Congress coalitions. A third party - the United Regional Front - led by jailed Marxist leader Akhil Gogoi - yet lags significantly behind in the exit polls, presumably because of its prioritization of religious issues, and an anti-CAA position that greatly coincides with Congress. To conclude, both the the BJP - which have offered a range of infrastructural developments, social improvements, and a nationalistic stance - and the Congress - which promises to reverse unemployment and offers a range of social schemes - have campaigned actively over the course of the past few months, supported by their coalitions, slandering the opposition with calumny, and, of course, have put on a contentious scrimmage to claw back power.</p>
