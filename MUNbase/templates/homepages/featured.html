          <h4 class="subh">The Assam Elections - coalitions, calumny and a contentious scrimmage to claw back power</h6>
          <p>By Ahaan Jindal</p>
          <h6 ><strong>Who’s vying for control - the major parties</strong></h6>
          <p>Pictures of Rahul Gandhi unveiling the Indian National Congress’ (INC) manifesto in Assam were made perspicuously evident on major national news channels: an indication of the Mahajoth’s - or INC coalition’s - commitment to regaining Assam, where the BJP had gained power in 2016, avenging 2011’s landslide Congress victory. The INC continues to garner traction in Assam, with a cascade of calumnious comments taking a dig at BJP’s allegedly nationalistic stance in the state coming from Rahul Gandhi: “they are attacking the culture, brotherhood and diversity in Assam.” At the same time, however, the incumbent party - the BJP’s coalition along with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) - are also wilful in their goal to keep Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in power, and regain the 126 MLA quota for the state’s 15th Legislative Assembly. Modi too took particular umbrage to the Congress’ exploits into the region, deeming the centre-left party’s policies “a display of their lack of leadership, policies and ideology.
          </p>
          <p>With polling commencing on 1st April, and fervent campaigning by three sides of the political spectrum in a post-Covid environment marred by instability - the BJP, Congress, and the United Regional Front - a “fringe” party vying to make inroads in the Northeast - the ensuing article aims to chronicle the policies and ideologies of each major front, at the eve of the Assam elections.</p>
          <h6 ><strong>What voters want</strong></h6>
          <p>A cursory glance at Assam’s economic parameters post-Covid highlights unemployment as a key issue plaguing the economy, with unemployment surging to 11.1% in April 2020. This was accompanied by a supply-chain disruption in the region, yielding a host of particularly pernicious implications for the retail and hospitality sector, as per the state’s finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sharma. Therefore, in the short-term, prospective voters would look quite favourably upon ensuring that job security is prioritized by the next cabinet, and solutions to supply and demand “shocks'' are wheedled out before vicious cycles could emerge and ravage Assam’s now-precarious economy. The tea garden workers will also prove significant to the final results, constituting a 17% majority in Assam’s population, and have actively contested lowered wages; while the Union Budget allocated a 1000 crore tranche of funds to the workers, representatives have yet complained about insufficient wages, and will seek promises of wage increases from either party. A more perennial predicament is the rampant lack of accessibility and interconnectivity in the region, which voters hope can be ring-fenced by significant infrastructure advancements. From a socio-cultural standpoint, the prevailing sentiment in the region is that the CAA needs to be repealed, made quite conspicuous by statewide December 2019 protests in the region. Assam in particular is a state wherein the implications of the CAA are the most pertinent and considerable, seeing as it was the only Indian state to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC), rendering 19 lakh inhabitants in the region “foreigners” - what was construed to be a blow for Assam’s ethnic diversity.
          </p>
          <h6 ><strong>The BJP’s bid to stay in control - their policies and ideology</strong></h6>
          <p>Firstly, the BJP’s policies in the region are mainly centred around a proliferation of infrastructure in the region, coupled with a constancy of “identity politics.” The former is evidenced by the fact that from 2016 till date, Modi has been increasing his focus on developing a slew of infrastructural establishments, ranging from longer, more interconnected roads, to schools and medical colleges, such as a 500-bed Nalbari Medical College and Hospital, for which the BJP has allocated a substantial 40 crore rupees. This largely infrastructural-focused stance stems from a severe lack of interconnectivity and what seemed like a significant topographical disadvantage for Assam in the years prior, costing the region employment opportunities as well as sociocultural integration and development. An advantage for BJP hence stems from increasing their electoral base through infrastructural consolidation - with a mammoth 37% of all highway ground built in the Seven Sisters between 2014 and 2019, as well as grandiose educational and medical edifices such as the National Law School and Lakhimpur Hospital, voters who earlier suffered from unemployment and impoverishment are gravitating towards the appeal of the BJP. The local perspectives echoed by the people of Assam largely favour this developmental phase brought to the table by the BJP; a striking example of this is shopkeeper Arun Barman’s take on why he will vote for the BJP: “There is so much work that has happened under them, especially road construction. This is something Assam needed badly. Look at our upcoming medical college, for instance, see how big and crucial it is.”  </p>
          <p>A far more ideologically-fuelled policy development in the region, however, is the public condemnation of Muslim Bangladeshis, who have seemingly “infiltrated” the region - another blatantly clear instance of the BJP’s “Hindutva” manifesto. The conservative nationalist party promises to “correct and reconcile” the currently updated Assamese NRC, and have declared that they will “exclude” all “illegal migrants” and “protect genuine Indian citizens.” This clear leaning towards the Hindutva playbook is not surprising at all, given the party’s extreme stance against Muslim All India United Democratic Front (AIUDC) leader Badruddin Ajmal, with derogatory comments such as “Ajmal...is not creating a network conducive to Assamese culture. Not as an individual, but as a group of certain people, they are our enemy,” coming from BJP Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. This apparent vendetta is clearly symbolic of BJP’s religious-secularism in the region, indicating that the BJP wishes to gain the traction of Hindu conservatives throughout the region, by appealing to the “pathos” of identity and oneness in the region. This has ostensibly propelled a significant proportion of religion-based policies: the BJP, aside from reforming the NRC, also wishes to protect Neo-Vaishnavite monasteries in the region, and solely provide land to “Indian citizens” - a bid to expand their vote banks to a vast majority of Hindus.</p>
          <p>From a social viewpoint, the BJP has, through the “ten commitment manifesto”, or “10 Sankalp for Atmanirbhar Assam”, promised to provide free education to every child, and have focused on developing schemes to reduce the material, human and geological impact of floods in the region, in light of the catastrophic 2020 Assam Floods, which claimed 149 lives and adversely impacted 30 out of 33 Assamese districts. Furthermore, the commitments also give assurance that families who fall under the “Orunodoi” scheme, which provides Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to around 17 lakh families in the state, will see a 261% increase in DBT, plus land rights, if the BJP comes into power. These social endeavours greatly mirror the ideological aim of “Atma Nirbhar”, or self-sufficiency for the region, and have played a significant role in polling numbers already, evidenced by the 42.1% BJP support in the exit polls.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the BJP has, through its infrastructural and developmental, religious, and social policies - greatly oriented to fit their nationalistic, Hindutva ideology, as well as their Atma Nirbhar campaign - aimed to expand their voter base and re-claim the treasured 126 MLA quota the largest of the “seven sisters” of the Northeast has to offer.</p>
          <h6 ><strong>Congress’ bid to regain a former 15-year stronghold: politics, ideology, and destructive slander</strong></h6>
          <p>The Congress coalition’s (Mahajoth) economic policies in the region seem to greatly appeal to two important groups of people who hold significant bearing on electoral results: the unemployed, as well as the Tea Garden workers of Assam, who hold the key to 40 seats in the region, and a substantial 5000 crores of the state income. With regard to bolstering employment in the region, the Mahajoth, under its released 5-pronged manifesto, have promised 5 lakh jobs if they are voted into power, presenting what seems to be a strong determinant in tilting the balance more towards the Centre-left party in the exit polls, by circumventing the constant near-10% unemployment in the region post-Covid. Moreover, in order to expand their electoral reach towards the tea garden workers, Congress has guaranteed a significant 120% rise in workers’ wages, to Rs. 365 per person, and have further aimed to garner their traction by echoing the issues brought forth by numerous workers’ representatives after the BJP reneged on its promise of increasing the tea workers’ wages to Rs. 367. Finally, the Congress also assured that they will provide a Rs. 2000 monthly income support to homemakers. Therefore, the Congress economic proclamation in their 5-point plan for Assam seems to appeal more to employment opportunities, and work and interaction at the grassroots level to muster traction from the tea garden workers to swing the electoral balances in their favour.
          </p>
          <p>From a religious viewpoint, the Mahajoth’s leaders have repeatedly condemned the Hindutva-leaning ideological stance of the BJP in Assam, deeming it a policy that fails to rekindle the spirit of brotherhood and diversity in the region. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the INC and its coalition parties have made their desire to repeal the CAA abundantly evident in rallies throughout February and March 2021. The ringleaders of the coalition have also, in speeches given throughout the campaigning period, dealt blows and highlighted what they see as great flaws in the BJP’s cultural nationalism - perhaps viewing it as a chance to increase their vote-banks to include proportions of the states 3.12 crore Muslim population, who seek asylum in the region, bound by the shackles of the CAA and NRC. That being said, the Mahajoth has not pinned a lot of its electoral focus on “identity politics,” instead preferring to offer the overarching aim of repealing the CAA in Assam - making clear that their agenda in the region transcends religious boundaries, and focuses more on socioeconomic amelioration.
          </p>
          <p>With regard to the social manifesto, the Congress seems to target issues on a grassroots level, and have actively campaigned in various districts, to considerably improve the lives and conditions for workers, mirroring their left-leaning ideology. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for example, visited the Sadhguru tea gardens in Assam earlier this month, and plucked tea leaves in solidarity with the disillusioned tea workers, to further reinforce the INC’s stance: “While they [BJP] have the money and the administration, we are campaigning better at the grassroots level.” With this stance firmly in mind, the Mahajoth has also actively rallied against surging fuel prices, holding statewide protests, some of which were led by MP Gaurav Gogoi, and have repeatedly alleged that the BJP has blatantly ignored the vicissitudes in fuel prices - yet another important social talking-point of the upcoming elections. In addition, the Mahajoth coalition also aims to provide free electricity upto 200 units in certain select districts in Assam, as mentioned by Rahul Gandhi in a March 2021 rally in Guwahati, in order to further their mass appeal.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, while the BJP’s main economic focus in Assam is infrastructure and increased interconnectivity, the Congress-led coalition has aimed to address the Covid-19-induced unemployment plaguing the entire state, and also various socioeconomic concerns; they also seem to not be excessively involved in “identity politics” and religious undertones, and as of now are fundamentally opposed to the CAA.
          </p>
          <h6 ><strong>Conclusion - what the polls indicate and a summary of the contesting parties</strong></h6>
          <p>The elections of Assam are one that is significant in the landscape of Indian politics, in that it will establish lasting patterns of leadership in the largest, most influential state of the Northeast: it may turn into a swing state for the May 2024 elections, or a BJP stronghold. The exit polls so far appear extremely closely contested, with a mere 2% difference between the BJP and Congress coalitions. A third party - the United Regional Front - led by jailed Marxist leader Akhil Gogoi - yet lags significantly behind in the exit polls, presumably because of its prioritization of religious issues, and an anti-CAA position that greatly coincides with Congress. To conclude, both the the BJP - which have offered a range of infrastructural developments, social improvements, and a nationalistic stance - and the Congress - which promises to reverse unemployment and offers a range of social schemes - have campaigned actively over the course of the past few months, supported by their coalitions, slandering the opposition with calumny, and, of course, have put on a contentious scrimmage to claw back power.</p>
