          <h3 id ='sovereignty'>The erosion of state sovereignty in the world of present day multipolarity</h3>
          <p><weight>By Arnav Joshi</weight></p>
          <p>Sovereignty, as defined by political theorist Jean Bodin is the absolute and perpetual power of the republic. The state, per Andrew Heywood is the system of centralised rule, capable of subordinating institutions. Max Weber, german sociologist and political theorist on the other hand, defined the state as the community that claimed monopoly over the legitimate use of violence. Taking these definitions forward, the extent of the claim that state sovereignty is an outdated concept in the 21st century can be examined. The response will aim to look at the claim that absolute sovereignty of a state is certainly on the decline in the 21st century, due to the increase in globalisation and formation of inter governmental organisations, as well as humanitarian intervention, however the sovereignty of a state is still retained in the fact that it exercises the power to choose which IGOs it associates itself with, and often times how the organisation will behave, owing to its structural power.
 The first factor that has led to the erosion of sovereignty in recent times is the formation of Supranational organisations.A supranational body is one which exercises jurisdiction not over any single state but within an international area comprising several states, according to Andrew Heywood in his book political theory. Supranational bodies include organisations such as the European Union. These bodies often pose a threat to the sovereignty of a state in several ways, the first of which being the reduction of the relevance of borders. A prime example of this is the European Union, where transit of people and resources has become free to a an extent where the borders within the European union have almost become obsolete. This does affect the sovereignty of a nation, however Heywood in political theory also does argue that states do have an inherent advantage due to the fact that they are bound by common culture and tradition. This may be true, but it ties with the second major factor leading to the erosion of sovereignty, globalisation. According to Anthony Mcgrew, it is the the multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between the states and societies. Because of this, the nation state no longer remains a homogenous community, and thus slowly loses the advantage it had when it comes to sovereignty over supranational bodies, vis a vis culture and tradition. The example for this again being the European Union where a research by pewresearchcenter suggested that 65% of europeans looked favourably at the european union and its abilities to promote peace and prosperity. Thus, supranationalism and globalisation do work in tandem to make sovereignty less relevant in todays world.
Secondly, humanitarian interventions in states act as significant threats to state sovereignty. The fact that states often carry out intervention in order to protect civilians is something that presents an inherent threat to the sovereignty of the nation. An example of this can be seen where USA, UK and France ran an intervention in Libya in 2011, an action which was sanctioned by the security council of the un. The fact that an intervention can and often is sanctioned by IGOs, grants legitimacy to it and thus diminishing the sovereignty and relevance of the nation state. The responsibility to protect is a doctrine which legitimises state intervention if another state is incapable of protecting its civilians. Liberalism promotes this, holding sovereignty as important but not exclusive, according to Robert Murphy et al. This further legitimizes the intervention of nations, however ti may be argued that in certain cases it may act as a non factor in the case of Syria, where despite warning from the obama administration that use of chemical weapons would result in intervention and action, the Assad regime in 2013 went ahead with the use of chemical, without any reprimand. The realist defend this, stating that states only take such intervening actions in order to protect their national interest, and in the case of Syria, the United States didnâ€™t deem it to be acting in national interest to intervene.
Another factor that has led to state sovereignty becoming obsolete is the growing concept of self determination. Self determination is the ability of a community to seek statehood and/or recognition. This leads to the creation of what are known as stateless nations, which due to their demand for separate sovereignty, often erode to sovereignty of the state they are in. The United Nations recognized self determination in 1970. The legitimation granted to this concept further threatens sovereignty, as can be seen in the case of several statehood movements such as the khalistan movement, the movement for a kurdish nation for the kurds, as well as that of the nation of kosovo. An ongoing sovereignty conflict of this nature is in Kashmir in india, where both India and Pakistan claim the land of kashmir, with large population of kashmir demanding self determination. Similarly in Balochistan, the Baluch people as they are called demand a separate state, something has led to skirmishes and conflicts too. This severely threatens the sovereignty of Pakistan.
A counter claim to this may be the fact that barring Kosovo, there have been no established cases of the success of self determination, which may insinuate that self determination has not acted as a threat to state sovereignty. Even kosovo for that matter has not received the complete recognition of statehood. Taking the example of Kashmir and Khalistan, the pursuit of the liberation of botht these has been on going for over half a century, to no avail. This certainly does diminish the extent to which the central claim is true here, as it does say that sovereignty of state has more often than not prevailed.
Another factor here to consider is the work of NGOs and other non profit organisations and the media. These two are known to diminish sovereignty as they often are known to critique the actions of the state in order to promote the rights of citizens. States often see this as an imposition on their sovereignty. Another problem NGOs pose to state sovereignty is that while a state can increase pressure on another state via economic sanctions, the same is ineffective with ngos as they work with monetary donations. The prime example of this in action is seen in China, where new laws were enacted in early 2017 preventing foreign ngo's from operating within state borders, or at least building a large roadblock to the same. Despite this, larger NGOs such as amnesty continue the critique of the chinese government and its crackdown on human rights officials, acting as a mechanism to erode china's state sovereignty.

Thus, it can be deduced that while supranational organisations, ngos, right to self determination and interventions do act as genuine factors for the obscurement of state sovereignty, the ability of states to control their interactions with these organisations does limit how effective these factors are in inhibiting sovereignty. Hence state sovereignty is an outdated concept in its absolute sense, however it still enjoys relatively strong position due to its control over state institutions and at times also the very sources of threat to it.
