This web app is MUNbase, an improved version of what I initially developed in CS50x. It utilizes Django, Javascript, HTML and CSS. It has multiple routes and uses sessionms of django to ensure users stay logged in.
Its a web app targeted for people who participate in MUNS. Personally, ive always felt that MUN forms are very repititve and this app aims to eliminate this issue. One can make, a profile, edit it and share it using this profile (data is saved using django models). It also has a search functionality, so as to search for other delegates. I also plan to implement more functionalities usin ForeignKeys in the future.

THE ONLY DEPENDENCY IS the passlib LIBRARY TO HASH PASSWORDS
